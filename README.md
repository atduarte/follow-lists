**Become a Pro by following the Experts.**

This project aims to create a solid list of curated Twitter Lists. 

Everyone can change/create lists, by making pull requests and all the changes in this repository are reflected in the lists of [@dev_lists](https://twitter.com/dev_lists) [WIP].

From developers, to developers.
